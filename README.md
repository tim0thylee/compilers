# compilers

This project covers 3 of the major steps of building a compiler: Lexical Analyzer, Syntactical Analyzer, and Assembler.

It is not a complete compiler, but covers some of the major steps in building one.

More detail is found in the documentation for each section. However, each section builds on each other starting from
the order Lexical Analyzer (LA) => Syntactical Analyzer (SA) => Assembler. That is why the SA and LA are one director Syntactical Analyzer. 

To run each program, simply double click the .exe file within each portion.
